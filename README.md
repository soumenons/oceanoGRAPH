# ðŸŒŠ oceanoGRAPH: Graph Neural Networks in Ocean Temperature Prediction
![](/img/worldmap_nodes.png?raw=true "Graph generated with Argo float data and a radius threshold of 500km")
The oceanoGRAPH project aims to investigate the feasibility of using graph neural networks (GNN) in ocean temperature prediction, particularly with the [Argo program](https://argo.ucsd.edu/) dataset.
(Based on our final project for AMATH 455 - Scientific Machine Learning)

## Overview
The Argo program conducts oceanographic research through fleets of floats deployed across the globe and has led to immense data collection in the field. However, the process involved is cost intensive and is exposed to errors and miscalibrations due to hardware and physical issues in the ocean. The goal of this project is to utilise the available float data in combination with graph neural networks as a better form of data imputation and as a cheaper means of artificially expanding the float fleet. The associated report investigates multiple GNN architectures through fine tuning data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning.
